# JOS_LAB
## Introduction
  &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To be honest, I wouldn't have done the JOS lab successfully, if there'd not been so many open-source code and unselfish coder. Maybe you are faced with same pressure from OS course as well. If you need the code, just clone or fork it. Forgive my laziness, I don't make an explaination. You can find guidance from below hyperlink.

## fix
  &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Due to version difference, in lab4, total score of clann24's version is 75. However, in newer version, it add one more test that judges whether ipc is able to send a vitural memory address correctly(user/sendpage.c). So total score of lab4 adjusted to 80 and there are some modifications in makefile. Open user/makefrag and kern/makefrag and you can tell the difference.
